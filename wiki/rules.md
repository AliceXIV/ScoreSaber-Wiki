# Rules

## General Rules


1.    **No multiaccounting.** The first account you make during login is your one and only ScoreSaber account, from the moment of its creation and forevermore. This account is YOU. It is not anyone else. Don't share your account with anyone else.

2.    **Play fair.** Using third-party utilities of any kind (any type of scripts, mods/plugins, applications, bots) to get any sort of advantage is not okay.

3.    **Be good to each other.** Harassment or other antagonism has no place within the ScoreSaber community.

4.    **No 18+/NSFW Content** This means 18+/NSFW content such as drug use or topics of a sexual nature are not allowed.


5.    Where the rules do not prevail, common sense shall. **The administration has explicit discretion to apply their judgment on this as they see fit.**

### Mappers with Ranked Maps

:::danger ⚠️ ATTENTION
If you have one or multiple maps that are ranked, you should never delete or republish said map from being available to players. If you are find deleting one of your ranked maps, you will be considered as unreliable and will then be banned from ranking any maps on ScoreSaber in the future.
