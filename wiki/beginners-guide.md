# Beginners Guide

## Installing ScoreSaber

### PC
Installing ScoreSaber on Beat Saber is relatively quick and easy. You need to install the mod onto your game, but before you go and install any mod, make sure to run the game at least once. This applies to reinstalling your game too.

Next, it is strongly recommended to use the ModAssistant installer, available [here](https://github.com/Assistant/ModAssistant/releases/latest) to get the ScoreSaber mod up and running.
:::warning üí° For safety, only install mods from this application since they are approved and verified mods.

When this is done installing, you can go ahead and launch Beat Saber.

### ScoreSaber Profile
To be able to see and edit your ScoreSaber profile, you must first submit a score on a custom map. Doing so will automatically create your profile based on your Steam or Oculus information, and add you onto the leaderboards.

On your profile, you should be able to see the following: Your username, profile picture, total amount of pp earned, global & local ranking and various other statistics about the scores you submitted to ScoreSaber.

If you would like more stats or features added to ScoreSaber and to profiles, make sure to first check if this wasn't already suggested [here](https://scoresaber.canny.io/feature-requests), and create a request about said feature.

### Badges and Biography
While browsing on various ScoreSaber profiles, you may come across profiles which look like this:
![Profile badges](~@images/ranking/badges.jpg)

All the icons that are seen on this profile header are badges. You can earn a badge by either achieving a rewarding rank during a community event such as a tournament, or by simply becoming a ScoreSaber supporter on patreon. Doing so will also add the possibility to have and edit a biography in order to personalize your ScoreSaber profile even more.
