# Beginners Guide

## Installing ScoreSaber
### PC
Installing ScoreSaber on Beat Saber is relatively quick and easy. You need to install the mod onto your game, but before you go and install any mod, make sure to run the game at least once. This applies to reinstalling your game too. 

Next, it is strongly recommended to use the ModAssistant installer, available [here](https://github.com/Assistant/ModAssistant/releases/tag/v1.1.28) to get the ScoreSaber mod up and running. 
:::tip ðŸ’¡ TIP 
For safety, only install mods from this application since they are approved and verified mods.

When this is done installing, you can go ahead and launch Beat Saber.


After the game is loaded, head over to Solo. If everything went well, you should see a new banner on the top of the leaderboards with the ScoreSaber logo, like so:

Congratulations ! You are now fully ready to use the ScoreSaber mod and submit scores onto custom maps !

## Using ScoreSaber

### ScoreSaber Profile
To be able to see and edit your ScoreSaber profile, you must first submit a score on a custom map. Doing so will automatically create your profile based on your Steam or Oculus information, and add you onto the leaderboards.

On your profile, you should be able to see the following: Your username, profile picture, total amount of pp earned, global & local ranking and various other statistics about the scores you submitted to ScoreSaber.

If you would like more stats or features added to ScoreSaber and to profiles, make sure to first check if this wasn't already suggested [here](https://scoresaber.canny.io/feature-requests), and create a request about said feature.

### Badges and Biography
While browsing on various ScoreSaber profiles, you may come across profiles which look like this:
![Profile badges](~@images/ranking/badges.jpg)

All the icons that are seen on this profile header are badges. You can earn a badge by either achieving a rewarding rank during a community event such as a tournament, or by simply becoming a ScoreSaber supporter on patreon. Doing so will also add the possibility to have and edit a biography in order to personalize your ScoreSaber profile even more.

### In-Game Leaderboards

With the ScoreSaber mod, you have access to various leaderboards within maps. This is to help players identify with ease how they compete with others around the world. You can use the icons on the left of each leaderboard to filter the scores that are shown:

- ![Global](~@images/globe.png) - Global leaderboard of selected map
- ![Around You](~@images/user.png) - The scores around yours
- ![Friends](~@images/group.png) - The scores from your friends
- ![Country](~@images/flag.png) - The scores from your local country

On each of these, you can use the Up and Down arrow on top and bottom of the icon list to scroll through the different shown score pages.
