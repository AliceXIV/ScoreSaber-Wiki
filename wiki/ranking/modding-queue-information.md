# Modding Queue Information

## What is this about?
The Modding Queue Category on our Discord Server is a category designed to promote **individual Modding queues** and to advertise open mods from people willing to take them.

If you wish to request a slot from a modder, please DM them, and they'll (hopefully) get back to you on whether they decide to take your offer.
:::warning Please always make changes to your map, and if you aren't, please provide ample justification! Please respect the modders!

### What is Modding?
Modding is a term borrowed from *osu!*. It is the process of reviewing and providing feedback for a map (for rankability or just general improvement) via editor and in-game analysis.

[See this guide](https://bit.ly/ScoreSaberModding) to get started with modding.
