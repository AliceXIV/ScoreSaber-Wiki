# ScoreSaber Team Information

## What does each role do within Scoresaber?

### Ranking Team (RT)

They are a group of mappers which take time to mod maps in order to make sure said maps follow every point from the ranking criteria. RT members also go through the ranking-queue and vote on maps that are meeting or not the ranking criteria. If errors are to be find, they will work with the mapper in order to resolve them.

### Quality Assurance Team (QAT)

They are a group of specialized players who play through the ranking-queue and vote on maps that are of high quality. Maps which have more QAT upvotes are more likely to be prioritized in the queue and get ranked faster. On the other hand, if QAT deems the map to be of "low quality", it will have a lower priority. The maps will eventually rise based on how long it has spent in the queue.

### Criteria Assurance Team (CAT)

As the name suggests, the people in the Criteria Assurance Team are in charge of maintaining the [ranking criteria](/ranking/criteria/). They also essentially are the writers of the [ranking criteria](/ranking/criteria/). Any changes which is decided by the CAT has to be approved by NAT and ScoreSaber Admins.

### Nomination Assessment Team (NAT)

Generally apart of the Ranking Team, they are the ones in charge of processing some internal interactions with the leaderboards such as denying, replacing and qualifying them, they constantly work towards keeping everything in check. NAT is also the team that moderates RT & QAT by ensuring there is no bias or system abuse.
